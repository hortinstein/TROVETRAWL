#### TROVETRAWL

Making sense of human generated messages

#### Problem

Ship schedules are sent in non-standard formatting, and it would be helpful for those schedules to be parsed into a machine readable format.

#### Premise

Use LLMs to go through a ship's message traffic to discern it's schedule and help automate checking for non standard data

#### Side Goals

Investigate the use of LLMs for structuring unstructured data for JADC2 applications.
